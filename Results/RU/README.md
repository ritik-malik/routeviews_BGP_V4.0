## Event

* A 6 hr long internet shutdown on 23rd Jan, 2021. [Source](https://netblocks.org/reports/internet-disrupted-in-russia-amid-opposition-protests-98aRXQAo)

## Results

* ~ 918 graphs, but >90% are false positives
* Mainly due to an error in `bokeh_graphs.py`, it counts the graph even if `max - min = 1`

**In conclusion, no correlation**

#### TODO: Fix `bokeh_graphs.py`
